# Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics #

This repository contains data samples and data generators used for Azure Stream Analytics tutorials.

## BuildApplications

This folder contains different application examples that you can choose to build a streaming application. You just need to follow the instructions on **README**, run a few commands in PowerShell, and it will deploy all the resources required for a streaming application with generated data streams. This is the easiest way to build a complete streaming application without preparing input data, and setting up a Stream Analytic job in the Azure portal.
